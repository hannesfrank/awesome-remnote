## URL Scheme

Some paths take rem ids as arguments:

- `document/*`
  - `document/REM_ID` opens this rem as a page.
  - `document/REM_ID?locationAnchor=HIGHLIGHT_REM_ID` focuses a child rem on the opened page.
  - `document/LEFT_REM_ID/RIGHT_REM_ID` to open two rems in split view.
- `queue/*`
  - `queue/REM_ID` practice all rem in `document/REM_ID` _with_ spaced repetition, i.e. don't ask flashcards which are not due yet.
  - `queue/REM_ID/all` practice all rem in `document/REM_ID` _without_ spaced repetition, i.e. ask flashcards even if they are not due. **TODO:** Check how the due time changes when you practice something due far in the future multiple times in a row. (You should not get too much credit.)
- `export/REM_ID` export a specific rem. ([remnote.io/export](https://www.remnote.io/export) to export all rem)
