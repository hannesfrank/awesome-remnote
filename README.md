### Frameworks
Starting a knowledge base from scratch can get chaotic. Here are some frameworks to help you structure.
- Zettelkasten/Evergreen Notes: Todo: Find visual guide/template. Maybe just this to get an idea: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jI2b1j9sL0I
  - I think to most important part is labeling permanent notes.
  - Fleeting and literature notes can be considered everything else.
  - Fleeting are represented by daily notes.
- Linking Your Thinking (Obsidian): https://www.linkingyourthinking.com/ Youtube: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC85D7ERwhke7wVqskV_DZUA/playlists
